Macro/isel_post.py
------------------

This file is derived for the original FreeCAD `linuxcnc_post.py`.

Currently, (C)CWABS commands are limited to the XY plane. Drill operations are also in alpha stages. If you want to improve the post-processor, ISEL provides wonderful [technical documentation](https://www.isel.com/en/support-downloads/manuals.html). Feel free to look at the NCP langage specification and send us a PR.
